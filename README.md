# Lens

`lens` is a query engine for navigating structured data using composable, Rust-inspired path expressions.

This crate implements the foundational query syntax for traversing nested data structures and is designed to serve as a foundation for higher-level tooling and data manipulation systems.

> **Status**: This implementation is currently in active development. APIs and behavior are subject to change as the project evolves toward stability.

## Problem Statement

Modern data processing requires working with multiple formats, each with its own query paradigm: JSONPath for JSON, XPath for XML, SQL for relational databases. This fragmentation creates cognitive overhead and limits interoperability between systems.

## Design Goals

- **Unified Query Language**: One unified syntax capable of querying any structured data format including JSON, TOML, XML, Markdown, etc.
- **Intuitive Syntax**: Language-inspired expressions rather than cryptic pattern matching
- **Composable Operations**: Declarative query composition enabling complex data navigation
- **Extensible Foundation**: Core primitives for building patching, linting, schema validation, and transformation tools

### Status

This crate is **pre-alpha**. Many features are stubbed out or only partially implemented. The syntax is still evolving and may change.

## Architecture Overview

### Query Composition Model

The query system is built around a hierarchical composition model:

- **Atoms**: Fundamental query units (identifiers, wildcards, ranges)
- **Molecules**: Sequences of atoms connected by path operators (`.`)
- **Queries**: Collections of molecules combined with logical operators

### Filter Operations

Filters apply conditional logic to data contexts. They support logical operators and implicit value validation.

### Lens Abstraction

The lens system treats molecules as first-class values by default. To access [magic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)>) data values rather than query expressions, special syntax is required. Rather than introducing new syntax, the system reuses the existing lens notation to represent literal values:

| Data Type | Lens Syntax       |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Integers  | `'0`, `'1`, `'42` |
| Booleans  | `'true`, `'false` |
| Null      | `'null`           |

This approach maintains syntactic consistency while clearly distinguishing between query expressions and literal values.

## Usage

The current implementation provides parsing and query iteration capabilities. **Data model integration is the responsibility of the implementing application.**

> **Note**: The tokenization layer is complete, but AST construction and evaluation remain in development. The crate is not yet suitable for production query execution.

### Integration Pattern

1. **Parse**: Convert query strings into `Expr` token streams using the provided parser
2. **Navigate**: Implement domain-specific logic to interpret `Expr` operations over your data model (e.g., `serde_json::Value`)
3. **Execute**: Handle advanced operations including:
   - Context binding and variable resolution
   - Filter evaluation (`~{ condition }`)
   - Post-filter projections
   - Aggregation and mutation operations

### Architecture Layers

- **Parser**: Provided by the `lens` crate
- **Navigator**: Application-specific data traversal logic
- **Executor**: Application-specific operation evaluation (required for full query support)

### Design Philosophy

The goal is to keep the core logic minimal and embeddable. Higher-level crates (e.g., `lens-json`, `lens-navigator`) can wrap this with easier APIs and common data backends later.
